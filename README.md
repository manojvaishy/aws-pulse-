# ⚡ AWS Pulse

> AI-powered AWS updates platform — personalized for your role, in your language.

## 🚀 Overview

AWS Pulse is a real-time AWS updates aggregator that simplifies technical announcements using AI, filters them by engineer role, and delivers them in English, Hindi, or Hinglish.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

AWS releases 100+ updates every month. Engineers miss critical deprecations and breaking changes buried in technical jargon — leading to production outages.

## ✅ Solution

- **Role-based feed** — DevOps, Developer, Architect, Data Engineer
- **AI-simplified summaries** — powered by Google Gemini
- **Multilingual** — English, Hindi, Hinglish
- **Critical alerts** — deprecation warnings before they break production
- **AI Chat assistant** — ask anything about any AWS update

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |

| AI Chat | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash |
